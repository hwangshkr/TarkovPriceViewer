# Notice - User
1. It cannot be used in full screen. Borderless windowed mode is recommended.
2. I do not take any responsibility for any disadvantages or damages including the above. However, there is no danger of ban, so don't worry. Overwolf's minimap overlay or RatScanner are also not a reason for ban.

# Notice - Developer
1. I'm a newbie developer who just graduated from college who used to program mostly in Java programs So please understand that most of the code is not optimized for C#. If you tell us about any strange parts in the code or where it can be improved, we will try to fix it as much as possible.
2. Originally, I was going to make a program that recognizes the image of the product itself, but there were too many variables in the image, so I stopped development and changed the direction to recognizing the name. If anyone can implement it, I'll try to fix it.
3. Capture the game screen, find the name with OpenCV and text it with Tesseract. If there are other free OCR modules, please recommend them.
